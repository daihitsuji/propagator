# Propagator
- Propagator quick sample using Spring boot and orekit.
- Serveur is running on the port 8080. Request can be send via postman or curl.
- User interface is also available on port 8888 if you follow the front end section
- Note that I didn't check coherency of returns value generated. Some bugs may have to be fixed ! :)
